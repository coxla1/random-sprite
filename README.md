# What is this?
I'm lazy, so I wrote a soft which automatically start required software, rename the seed to match an MSU Pack and transfer it via USB to SNES.
Starting Dunka's tracker requires Microsoft Edge.

Many thanks to Synack for providing the [pyz3r library](https://github.com/tcprescott/pyz3r)!

# Ok cool, how do I use this?
You can find the latest version on the [Releases](https://github.com/coxla1/random-sprite/releases) page.
Just download the executable and start using it!
Currently this is Windows only, but I'm looking into compiling it for macOS and Linux as well.
