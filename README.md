# What is this?
I'm lazy, so I wrote a soft to open everything I need when I play a seed (timer, tracker, emulator if I don't have access to my console).

It can also pick a given MSU Pack or a random one, and features a weighted random sprite list (so you can play with random sprites with visible shadow for instance).

Starting tracker will only work on Windows and requires Google Chrome (may change in the future).

Many thanks to Synack for providing the [pyz3r library](https://github.com/tcprescott/pyz3r)!

# Ok cool, how do I use this?
You can find the latest version on the [Releases](https://github.com/coxla1/random-sprite/releases) page.

Just download the executable and start using it!

Currently this is Windows only, but I'm looking into compiling it for macOS and Linux as well.

If you are on one of these systems, you can run it from the source code, but some features may not be available (eg, starting tracker or emulator).

# Running it from source
* Download sources from the [Releases](https://github.com/coxla1/random-sprite/releases) page.
* Install Python (3.8+ recommended, not sure which version is compatible otherwise).
* In a command line, install the requirements using : `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Start it with the command `python gui.py`

# Bug reports
Feel free to contact me on Discord (Coxla#2119) if you find any bug.
However I'm not into adding features as of now.
